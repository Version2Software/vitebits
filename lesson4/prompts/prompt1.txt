You are an expert javascript programmer. Generate a native web component written in javascript. The component will be named ProjectOne.js and will be placed in a src directory. It will display "hello name". Name will have a default value of "world", but it can be overridden by supplying an attribute called name. Draw a red box around the component. Also, create an index.html file that uses the project-one component. I am using vite and I want to import the ProjectOne.js as a module.
