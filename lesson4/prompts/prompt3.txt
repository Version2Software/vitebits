Create a countdown timer web component using Typescript, Lit 3, and decorators. Save it in a file call src/TimerComponent.ts. There is an optional attribute called duration, which specifies the number of minutes to count down. The default is 30 minutes. There are two buttons: Start/Stop and Pause/Resume. Put a thin gray border around the component. The label of each button changes depending on state. Just generate the code with no explanation.
